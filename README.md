# The Dying of the Light

A game completed for the Ludum Dare 39 competition.

## About This Project

This repository was originally used by team during the competition. I have since removed all assets that didn't belong to me in order to protect my teammates amazing work from possible theft.

## How to View Source Code

Because the source was written entirely in blueprints, in order to view it you will have to recompile the project and launch a UE4 editor.

First double-click the UE4 project file in the project folder __(LD39\LD39.ueproject)__.

__NOTE: Launching the game from the project file will cause it to crash.__

A Dialog box will appear. Select the engine version of UE4 that you currently have installed __(Currently works on UE4 version 4.18)__.

Wait a moment for the project files to generate, then a "Missing LD39 Modules" dialog box will appear. Select yes.

After a few moments the project will compile and launch the editor.

## About the Source Code

Unfortunately due to the missing assets you won't be able to compile a release of the game. The code provided is purely for the reader's education.

Most of the code was quickly hacked together over a short period for the competition and I have not touched it since.

At the moment I have no intentions of using this code, but if you find something useful feel free to use it in your own projects.
